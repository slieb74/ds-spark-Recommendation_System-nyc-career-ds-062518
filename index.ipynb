    "Recommender/Recommendation Systems are one of the most successful applications of machine learning in the Big Data domain. Such systems are integral parts in the success of Amazon (Books, Items), Pandora/Spotify (Music), Google (News, Search), YouTube (Videos) etc.  For Amazon these systems bring more than 30% of their total revenues. For Netflix service, 75% of movies that people watch are based on some sort of recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal of Recommendation Systems is to find what is likely to be of interest to the user. This enables organizations to offer a high level of personalization and customer tailored services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For online video content services like Netflix and Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important. An example of recommendation system is such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.\n",
    "    User B performs a search query for Game of Thrones.\n",
    "    The system suggests Breaking Bad to user B from data collected about user A.\n",
    "    \n",

We looked at how Spark's ALS implementation can be be used to build a scalable and efficient reommendation system. We also saw that such systems can become computationaly expensive and using them with an online system could be a problem with traditional computational platforms. Spark's disctributed computing architecture provides a great solution to deploy such recommendation systems for real worls applications (think Amazon, Spotify)."
